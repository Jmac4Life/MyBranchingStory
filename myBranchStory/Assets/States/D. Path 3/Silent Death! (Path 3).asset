  strStoryText: "Skull, sensing the danger in revealing his identity to Gus, decided
    to stay quiet and kept his name to himself. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Gus's strong
    hatred towards the Mohawk Makers clouded his judgment. Unable to see past appearances,
    Gus mistakenly believed Skull to be associated with the group he despised. This
    tragic misjudgment resulted in Gus taking Skull's life, a devastating consequence
    of misunderstanding. \n\nSkull DIED!\n1. Try Again."
